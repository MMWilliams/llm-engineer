    "\n",
    "## Assignment Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Ingestion\n",
    "* Provide a dataset (e.g., JSON, CSV, or unstructured text files) that includes a mix of structured and unstructured data\n",
    "* Create a pipeline to load this data into a database of your choice, ensuring the schema is optimized for querying\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "* Handle data that may contain noise or require transformation (e.g., text cleaning, parsing nested JSON, handling missing values)\n",
    "* Demonstrate how to preprocess the data for efficient storage and later retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectorization\n",
    "* Use a pre-trained language model or embeddings model to convert unstructured text into embeddings\n",
    "* Store these embeddings in a vector storage solution of your choice\n",
    "* Ensure the pipeline can handle batch processing for larger datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query and Retrieve\n",
    "* Create a simple API or script that allows querying based on a given text prompt\n",
    "* Implement retrieval of similar embeddings from the vector store and return corresponding database records\n",
    "* Include a use case for Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "  * Retrieved data should be used to generate a summary or response based on the query\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation\n",
    "* Document your code\n",
    "* Explain the thought process behind design choices\n",
    "* Discuss any trade-offs considered (e.g., schema design, vector storage approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus Points\n",
    "* Implement monitoring or logging for the data pipeline\n",
    "  * Track data flow\n",
    "  * Identify potential bottlenecks\n",
    "* Optimize the pipeline for scalability\n",
    "  * Handle larger files\n",
    "  * Implement parallel processing"
